=========

A standard API that provides methods for Graphs.

### Documentation

   This package represents a general unlabeled graph whose vertices are denoted by positive integers.  A graph may be directed or undirected.  For an undirected graph, outgoing and incoming edges are the same. Graphs may have self edges, but no multi-edges (edges with the same end points). Edges in a Graph are ordered by the sequence in which they were added.
